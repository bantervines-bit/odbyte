We're excited to introduce **Prompt Bundles** — a game-changing way to organize your AI prompts.

If you've ever felt overwhelmed by dozens (or hundreds) of saved prompts, bundles are about to change everything.

## What are Bundles?

Think of bundles like **playlists for your prompts**. 

Just like you organize songs into playlists for different moods or activities, you can now organize prompts into bundles for different projects or use cases.

**Examples:**
- "SEO Writing Kit" - All your SEO-related prompts in one place
- "Product Launch Copy" - Everything you need for a launch
- "Social Media Pack" - Daily content prompts
- "Client Projects" - Prompts specific to client work

## Why Bundles Matter

### 1. Stay Organized
No more scrolling through hundreds of prompts to find the one you need.

### 2. Work Faster
Access project-specific prompts instantly. Switch between projects effortlessly.

### 3. Share Easily
Send entire bundles to teammates or clients with one shareable link.

### 4. Export Everything
Download bundles as CSV, JSON, or import directly to Notion.

## How to Create a Bundle

Creating bundles is simple:

1. **Go to your Dashboard**
2. **Click "Create Bundle"**
3. **Give it a name** (e.g., "Email Marketing Kit")
4. **Add prompts** - Select from your saved prompts
5. **Choose visibility** - Keep it private or generate a share link

That's it! Your bundle is ready to use.
