Bad prompts get bad results. Good prompts? They're like magic. The AI suddenly "gets it" and delivers exactly what you need.

The difference between amateur and pro prompt writers isn't talent. It's knowing the framework.

## The 4-Part Prompt Framework

Every great prompt has four parts. Master these and you'll never write a bad prompt again.

### 1. Context (Who & What)

Tell the AI who it is and what you're working on. This sets the stage for everything.

**Bad:**
```
Write a blog post about marketing.
```

**Good:**
```
You're a digital marketing expert writing for small business owners who want to grow their online presence. Write a blog post about email marketing.
```

### 2. Task (What You Want)

Be crystal clear about what you want the AI to do. Vague requests get vague results.

**Bad:**
```
Help me with my presentation.
```

**Good:**
```
Create a 5-slide presentation outline about sustainable packaging for eco-conscious consumers. Include: key stats, benefits, and a call-to-action.
```

### 3. Format (How You Want It)

Specify the structure, length, tone, and style. The more specific, the better.

**Examples:**
- "Write it in a casual, conversational tone"
- "Keep it under 500 words"
- "Use bullet points for the main ideas"
- "Format it as a table with 3 columns"

### 4. Constraints (What to Avoid)

Tell the AI what NOT to do. This prevents common mistakes.

**Examples:**
- "Don't use jargon"
- "Avoid clich√©s and buzzwords"
- "Don't mention competitors"
- "Keep it professional, no emojis"

## Real Example: Before & After

**Before (Bad):**
```
Write something about productivity.
```

**After (Good):**
```
You're a productivity coach writing for remote workers struggling with distractions. Write a 400-word blog post about the Pomodoro Technique. Include: what it is, how to do it (step-by-step), 3 benefits, and 1 common mistake to avoid. Use a friendly, motivational tone. Don't use corporate jargon.
```

See the difference? The second prompt gives the AI everything it needs to create exactly what you want.

## Pro Tips

**Tip 1:** Use Examples
Show the AI what you want. "Write it like this: [example]"

**Tip 2:** Iterate
Your first prompt won't be perfect. Refine and improve based on the results.
